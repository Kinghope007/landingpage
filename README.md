Inspiration
The Train Notifications System was inspired by the need for a reliable and efficient way to receive notifications about train schedules and delays. As commuters ourselves, we understand the frustration of not knowing when our next train will arrive or if there are any disruptions in service. With this project, we aim to provide a solution that keeps passengers informed in real-time.

Technical Details
The Train Notifications System is built using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. We use Google Maps API to retrieve train station data and provide directions. The frontend interface is designed to be user-friendly, with intuitive controls for searching train stations, viewing schedules, and receiving notifications.

Challenges
i had alot of challaneges being the one coding and trying to solve the problems its still at a very small stage but can still be worked on more myself only cannot have all the knowledge but i try 

Future Improvements
In the future, we plan to enhance the Train Notifications System with additional features such as real-time updates on train arrivals and departures, personalized notifications based on user preferences, and integration with other transportation services. We also aim to optimize the performance and scalability of the application to accommodate a larger user base.

Acknowledgements
We would like to thank our mentors and instructors at Holberton School for their guidance and support throughout the development of this project. Additionally, we appreciate the feedback and contributions from the open-source community, which have helped shape the Train Notifications System into what it is today.
